Make the footer and navbar consistent across all pages, and sizes

##### Home Page
- No home page

##### About Page
- Navbar is too small to match the prototype
- The Story Behind the Grill
    - The Story Behind the Grill section is not wide enough. The prototype shows the image wider
    - The section needs space between the image and the text
    - The section title is not large/bold enough
    - Not enough text for the section

- Our Team
    - No text in section is the correct font
    - Cards are not wide enough
    - Footer is too close to cards

##### Menu Page
- Nav text is not the correct font
- Most titles on this page are not the correct font
- Sandwiches card had extra line underneath the title description
- Lines under food items don't extend out far enough
- Prices text is too small
- Footer is not lined up with ends of cards

##### Catering Page
- Nav text does not match prototypes spacing
- Catering title does not match font
- Page margins on sides are too large. Page sections should be wider
- Our Catering Services
    - Section cols are the same width, but prototype shows that the image col is smaller than the text col
    - The text column spacing does not match the prototypes (the spacing around the text and the line height)
    - Footer copy right is not lined up with the end of the logo image

##### Photo Page
- Same nav text issue
- Photos title not the correct font
- Side margins need to be less
- A little more border width on the images


#### Tablet
Tested at 768px

##### About Page
- The story behind the grill image does not match the section height (has white background underneath)
- Out team cards look too stretched, could change from 3 columns to 2 columns at this size

##### Menu Page
- Footer looks off at this size, becomes two rows, and things are still at opposite ends (could still be one row, or have the two sections aligned directly on top of each other)

##### Catering Page
- Our Catering services image does not match this sections height (could make it so the image appears on top of the text or hide the image at this size)

##### Photo Page
- Footer logo looks a tiny bit stretched

Try to get the navbar toggle to not move when the nav menu expands

##### About Page
- Margins at this screen side and be minimal (remove some margin so the sections are wider)

##### Menu Page
- Prices clip outside of menu cards
- Again I would remove some of the margins on the sides
- Navbar does not expand (I think I already helped you solve this one)

##### Catering Page
- You can remove one of the starting images
- Text column is wider than the rest of the page
